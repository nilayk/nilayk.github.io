## 💼 Professional Experience

### Senior Software Engineer
**AdSupply Inc** | *June 2011 - Present* | Culver City, CA

Senior engineer on a real-time ad exchange and serving platform, focused on distributed systems, low-latency delivery, production reliability, and fraud mitigation. Contributed to .NET Framework to .NET Core modernization across a hybrid cloud environment (Azure and AWS).

**Key Achievements:**
- Optimized the core ad exchange and serving platform and contributed to .NET Framework to .NET Core modernization
- Supported low-latency ad delivery at scale (approx. 1B+ daily requests; sub-100ms responses), integrating with multiple SSPs and DSPs
- Tuned critical data paths with MongoDB and Redis, improving maintainability and performance of hot codepaths
- Implemented pub/sub messaging to propagate database updates to live serving nodes, enabling in-memory entity lookups and reducing database reads on the request path
- Improved reliability with production safeguards, including Cloudflare-based controls to mitigate traffic anomalies and overload
- Enhanced observability via New Relic instrumentation/configuration and operational diagnostics (including Kibana)
- Owned fraud mitigation initiatives within the delivery pipeline to improve traffic quality and revenue integrity
- Originated the Web Push ad format concept; built the initial prototype and early integrations; led subsequent team expansion
- Owned ad unit delivery scripts and ad tags across browsers and partner constraints; led content-blocker compatibility work to improve delivery under common blocking techniques
- Built internal tooling and automation: ASP.NET Core apps, JavaScript analytics utilities, and Druid-based tracking and aggregation workflows
- Led support engineering and production issue resolution; participated in incident response/on-call and drove code/design reviews with senior engineers

*Selected initiatives: Adblock compatibility; compliance-driven flow and parameter changes; cross-browser tag debugging; overload and timeout mitigation; observability and runtime diagnostics improvements.*
